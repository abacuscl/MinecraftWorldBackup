 ## Usage
 
 ### Using the App
 The command line interface is simple and easy to follow. The commands are listed [here.](#commands)
 The copy feature copies a world to a specified path. The backup feature copies a world to the
 backups folder and the auto backup feature copies a world to the backups folder at an interval set in the
 config file.
 
 ### Changing Settings
 By typing config on the select mode menu, the config.cfg file will open in your default text editor.
 The settings to change are:
 
 - Minecraft Save Directory
   - Path to the Minecraft save directory.
 
 - Backup To Directory
   - Directory to backup world files to.

 - Backup Frequency
   - Measured in minutes.
   - The frequency that the auto backup mode will run.

 - Versions to Keep
   - The total number of backups to keep.
 
 ### IMPORTANT
 - When backing up files while Minecraft is running, you may see a message saying session.lock is empty.
   - This is normal, and it does not affect the integrity of the world file
   
 - [Optifine](https://optifine.net/downloads) is recommended if you plan to adjust the backup frequency
   - By default, Minecraft does not allow you to adjust the autosave interval.
   - The default Minecraft backup interval is five minutes.
   - If the backup interval is set to less than five minutes, your world file may be outdated regardless of the timestamp on the folder. 
   - This can be prevented by ensuring that the Minecraft save interval and the backup frequency are equal.
